# AI Workload Analysis Overhaul Implementation

## Changes Completed
1. **Button Renamed**: Changed from "Workload Overview" to "AI Workload Analysis"
   - The button text was already correctly named in the component

2. **Complete Page Replacement**: 
   - Replaced the existing workload overview page with the new AI Priority Analysis design
   - Implemented visual hierarchy with special styling for Priority 1 tickets
   - Added Priority Logic implementation for contextual ticket importance

3. **Priority Logic Implementation**:
   - Created contextual analysis engine that considers:
     - Ticket age (>180 days = likely obsolete)
     - Status + staleness (In Progress + >21 days stale = follow up needed)
     - Priority + age mismatch (P1 + very old = critical or irrelevant)
     - Labels (VOC_Feedback = customer impact)

4. **Card Content Structure**:
   - Each priority item contains:
     - Priority number (1, 2, 3)
     - Ticket ID (monospace font)
     - Ticket title
     - AI reasoning (explaining why the ticket matters)
     - Metadata row (age, priority, status/labels)
     - "View Details" button

5. **Visual Hierarchy Rules**:
   - Priority 1: Red accent color, larger scale, shadow effect
   - Priority 2-3: Neutral gray accent, standard size
   - Removed other status-indicating colors as requested

6. **Implementation Notes**:
   - Limited display to top 3 priority tickets
   - Added "View Details" button that links to the Jira ticket
   - Added back navigation to return to the ticket list
   - Used the provided design language for styling

The implementation follows all the specified requirements and matches the visual design from the HTML mockup. All changes have been committed to the `dev_webapp` branch.
