## Project Context
- Current project type: Personal Ticket Assistant application
- Tech stack: 
  - Backend: Python, FastAPI, Jira API integration, LLM integration (Ollama/OpenAI)
  - Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
  - CLI UI: Rich library
- Architecture patterns: 
  - Service-oriented with distinct modules

  - Performance (caching of analysis)
  - User experience (clear, focused UI)

## Coding Patterns
- Functional React components with hooks
- Python modules with clear separation of concerns
- Environment variable configuration for security
- Git workflow with feature branches (dev_webapp)

## Context7 Research History
- React component styling with Tailwind CSS
- FastAPI endpoint structuring
- LLM integration best practices

## Conversation History
- Initial exploration of the codebase and understanding app structure
- Fixed security issues with exposed API tokens in scripts
- Implemented AI Workload Analysis Overhaul with new UI design and priority logic
- Updated visual design based on provided HTML mockup

## Notes
- The application integrates with Jira for ticket retrieval and analysis
- Uses AI to prioritize tickets based on contextual importance
- Has both CLI and web interfaces
- Latest work focused on enhancing the web UI for AI ticket analysis
- Design requirements specified a clear visual hierarchy for priority tickets
