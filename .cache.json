This ticket has been open for 209 days, which is a relatively long time. What's more concerning is that it's marked as \"To Do,\" indicating that someone hasn't had a chance to work on it yet.\n\nThe issue here is a security vulnerability that could allow unauthorized access to devices in your environment. The VOC_Feedback label indicates that this is a customer-impacting problem, and I strongly advise we address it ASAP.\n\n**Next Concrete Steps:**\nTo tackle this ticket, I recommend the following next steps:\n\n1. Review the current implementation of Snow integration with Jamf to understand where the issue lies.\n2. Reach out to your Snow admin team to gather more information about the failure and identify potential root causes.\n3. Collaborate with the IT team to develop a plan to fix the issue, which might involve updating Snow or Jamf configurations.\n\n**Specific Ways I Can Help:**\nI can help you by:\n\n1. Reviewing the current Snow-Jamf integration setup to ensure we have all the necessary documentation and information.\n2. Helping you craft an email to the Snow admin team to get more information about the failure.\n3. Assisting with testing and validation of the proposed fix to ensure it resolves the issue.\n\n**Notable Tickets:**\nTwo other tickets that caught my attention are:\n\n1. **CPE-2925 [PRD] Enhancing Security and Change Management for Jamf**: This epic has been open for a while (320 days) and seems to be related to security and change management. While it's not as pressing as CPE-3117, I think we should keep an eye on this one since it involves critical aspects of our Jamf implementation.\n2. **EUSOPS-180 Review Enrolled Vendors to ABM**: This ticket has been open for 595 days, which is quite old. Given the VOC_Feedback label, I assume there's a business impact associated with this issue. Let's prioritize reviewing these vendors and validating their access to our Teneat.\n\nHow do you feel about tackling CPE-3117 first? Would you like me to help with any of the next steps or provide more information on other tickets?", "top_key": "CPE-3117"}, "session": {"current_focus": null}}
