The user has provided a list of tickets and wants help prioritizing their workload. First, I need to go through each ticket and apply the priority rules they mentioned.\n\nStarting with the priority rules: P1/Critical tickets are top priority, but all these are P3. Next, \"In Progress\" tickets need attention. Then, very old tickets over 300 days are less urgent unless high priority. Security issues, failures, or blocking problems are important regardless of priority. Also, business impact and VOC_Feedback labels matter.\n\nLooking through the tickets, the first one is CPE-3117 with the label VOC_Feedback. The status is \"To Do,\" but the description mentions failed auto lock on Macs via Snow integration. The user says devices aren't enrolled in Jamf but are in pre-stage enrollment. This seems like a failure that's affecting device management, which is critical for security. The VOC_Feedback label indicates customer impact, so this should be a top priority.\n\nNext, CPE-3118 is about making LAPS passwords easier for technicians. It's also a \"To Do\" with no labels, but the issue is about usability. Not as urgent as the previous one.\n\nCPE-3179 is a sub-task with no description. Not sure about its impact.\n\nLooking for other tickets, CPE-2458 is an epic that's been open for over 500 days. That's very old, but it's a security and architecture review. However, without a higher priority, maybe not urgent unless there's a security risk.\n\nCPE-2866 is about developing a policy on which computers should be locked. It's a \"To Do\" with no labels, so maybe lower priority.\n\nCPE-3117 seems the most urgent because of the VOC_Feedback and the failure in device management. The next step would be to investigate why the devices aren't enrolling, check the pre-stage enrollment settings, and ensure that the Snow integration is correctly configured. The user might need to work with the Snow team or check Jamf logs for errors. They might also need to create a KB article for troubleshooting enrollment failures, which is mentioned in CPE-3222.\n\nOther notable tickets: CPE-3118 (LAPS password issue) and CPE-2458 (security review). But the former is more about user experience, and the latter is a long-term project.\n\nSo, the top priority is CPE-3117 because of the customer impact and the failure in a critical process. The next steps are troubleshooting the enrollment issue and collaborating with relevant teams. The user might need help creating a KB article for future reference and ensuring that the Snow integration is properly set up.\n</think>\n\n**Top Priority Ticket: CPE-3117 - \"Failure - Auto lock macs via snow integration\"**  \n**Why?** This is a **critical failure in device management** with **VOC_Feedback** (customer impact). If devices aren\u2019t auto-locking, it creates a **security risk** (unsecured devices) and **impacts user experience** (users can\u2019t work securely). The ticket also mentions devices are in pre-stage enrollment but not enrolled in Jamf \u2014 this is a **blocker for automation** and could indicate a systemic issue in your enrollment process.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for CPE-3117**  \n1. **Troubleshoot the Snow integration**: Check if Snow is correctly configured to trigger auto-lock actions in Jamf. Are there logs in Snow/Jamf showing why devices aren\u2019t being enrolled?  \n2. **Validate pre-stage enrollment**: Why are devices in pre-stage but not enrolled? Is there a missing step (e.g., user interaction, missing payloads)?  \n3. **Create a KB article** (see CPE-3222): Document how to collect logs for failed enrollment to prevent this in the future.  \n\n---\n\n### **How I Can Help**  \n- **Dig into logs**: I can help draft a script or guide to pull logs from Snow/Jamf to identify why enrollment is failing.  \n- **Collaborate with Snow team**: If you need help coordinating with Snow or Jamf support, I can help draft a request.  \n- **Design a KB article**: I\u2019ll help structure the steps to troubleshoot enrollment failures.  \n\n---\n\n### **Other Notable Tickets**  \n1. **CPE-3118 - \"Make LAPS Passwords for GCS Admin Easier\"**: Technicians are struggling with 29-character passwords. This is a **user experience/blocker** for support teams. Fixing this would save time and reduce errors.  \n2. **CPE-2458 - \"Complete Jamf security & architecture review\"**: This is **578 days old** and labeled as a security review. While not urgent, if there\u2019s a known security gap (e.g., unpatched configs), this should be elevated.  \n\n---\n\n**Quick Summary**: Focus on **CPE-3117** first \u2014 it\u2019s a **security-critical failure** with customer impact. Then, address **CPE-3118** to improve technician workflows. Keep an eye on **CPE-2458** if security audits are pending. Let me know if you need help drafting logs or KB articles!"}, "CPE-3117:The user specifically asked for help with this ticket": {"timestamp": "2025-09-03T13:25:48.988982", "suggestion": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking for help with a Jira ticket called CPE-3117. The main issue is that some Macs aren't being auto-locked via the Snow integration. The devices are either not found in Jamf or are in pre-stage enrollment but not locked. Also, when the API fails, the notifications go to the Snow team instead of the CPE team, and they want to change that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the next logical steps. The ticket is old, 209 days, so maybe it's been sitting for a while. The priority is P3, which is lower, but the age is a problem. The user wants to move it forward.\n\nThe main points here are the failed auto-lock attempts and the notification routing. For the auto-lock issue, the devices not being enrolled in Jamf but in pre-stage enrollment might indicate a problem with the enrollment process or the integration setup. Maybe the Snow integration isn't correctly identifying these devices, or there's a delay in enrollment. Checking the Snow and Jamf configurations would be important here. Also, looking at the API logs for any errors related to those specific devices could help pinpoint why they're not being locked. The error message mentioned a 404, which is a resource not found error, so maybe the URLs used in the integration are incorrect or the devices aren't properly registered in Jamf.\n\nThen there's the notification part. The current setup sends failure alerts to the Snow team, but the CPE team wants them. Changing the mail alias to CPE's email is a possible solution. Alternatively, setting up a ticketing system or a webhook in ServiceNow to send alerts directly to CPE's ticketing system might be more scalable. The user mentioned creating a ticket for tracking, which could be a good idea for long-term management. They might need to contact the Snow team or the integration team to adjust the notification settings.\n\nAlso, the user mentioned a screenshot of an error note in the asset record. Even though the comment says a screenshot is attached, the actual ticket might not have it. They should check if that's available. If not, maybe they need to request it from the person who created the ticket or the Snow team.\n\nAnother thing is the pre-stage enrollment. Maybe those devices are not being properly enrolled in Jamf, so the auto-lock process can't find them. Checking the enrollment policies in Jamf and ensuring that the Snow integration is correctly configured to handle pre-stage enrolled devices could be necessary. Maybe there's a step missing in the enrollment process that's causing the devices to be in pre-stage but not fully enrolled.\n\nThey might also need to look into the Snow instance to see how the devices are being synced with Jamf. Are there any sync errors or delays? Maybe the integration isn't pulling in the latest device statuses from Jamf, leading to the devices not being recognized.\n\nFor the notification part, changing the mail alias is straightforward, but if that's not feasible, setting up a ticketing system integration would be better. They should consult with the CPE team to determine the preferred method. Maybe the Snow team can help adjust the notification settings, or the CPE team can set up a webhook or integration with their ticketing system.\n\nIn terms of actionable steps, the immediate next steps should be to check the integration logs for the specific error codes, verify the Snow and Jamf configurations, and adjust the notification settings. They might need to contact the Snow team or the CPE team for access to the necessary systems or configurations. Also, creating a ticket in their own system to track the notification changes would be a good idea.\n\nI should make sure the response is specific, actionable, and mentions contacting specific people or checking specific configurations. Also, mention the need to check any attached files like the screenshot of the error note. Maybe suggest reaching out to the Snow team or the integration team for assistance with the API logs and configuration checks.\n</think>\n\nLet\u2019s break this down and take actionable steps to resolve the issue. Here\u2019s what needs to happen **immediately**:\n\n---\n\n### **1. Investigate the Auto-Lock Failure (Devices Not Found / Not Locked)**\n**Action Steps:**\n- **Check Snow/Jamf Integration Logs:**  \n  Look for logs in **ServiceNow (Snow)** and **Jamf Pro** for API calls related to the failed devices (LTXT41N702, 4W9JVTQX9, C02CL0RJMNHY). Focus on:  \n  - Whether the integration is attempting to lock these devices.  \n  - Any **404 errors** (resource not found) or other API errors.  \n  - The **URL path** mentioned in the error (e.g., is it correct? Are the device IDs properly formatted?).  \n  - If logs are unclear, **contact the Snow team** to share the logs for these specific devices.  \n\n- **Verify Device Enrollment Status in Jamf:**  \n  - Confirm that these devices are **not enrolled** in Jamf but are in **pre-stage enrollment**.  \n  - Check if **pre-stage enrollment policies** are correctly configured to trigger auto-lock via Snow.  \n  - Are there **enrollment delays** or missing steps in the pre-stage process?  \n\n- **Test Manually:**  \n  Manually lock one of the failed devices (e.g., 4W9JVTQX9) via Snow/Jamf and observe if it works. This will help determine if the issue is a **configuration bug** or a **device-specific problem**.\n\n---\n\n### **2. Fix Notification Routing to CPE Team**\n**Action Steps:**\n- **Update Snow Integration Settings:**  \n  - Locate the **notification configuration** in **ServiceNow** (e.g., under \"Notification Rules\" or \"Email Templates\").  \n  - **Change the mail alias** from the Snow team to the **CPE team\u2019s email** (e.g., `cpe-team@yourdomain.com`).  \n  - If this isn\u2019t possible, **create a new notification rule** in ServiceNow to send alerts directly to the CPE team.  \n\n- **Set Up a Ticketing System Integration (Optional but Recommended):**  \n  - If the CPE team uses a ticketing system (e.g., Jira), configure **ServiceNow to create tickets automatically** when the Snow/Jamf integration fails.  \n  - This avoids relying on email and ensures visibility in CPE\u2019s workflow.  \n  - **Contact the CPE team** to discuss this (e.g., @Ashwin.Kumar if he\u2019s involved).  \n\n- **Test the Notification Fix:**  \n  - Trigger a test error in the Snow/Jamf integration (e.g., by intentionally breaking an API call) to confirm the CPE team receives the alert.  \n\n---\n\n### **3. Escalate and Coordinate**\n**Action Steps:**\n- **Contact the Snow Team:**  \n  - Ask them to share the **attached screenshot** of the error note in the asset record (if available).  \n  - Request logs for the specific devices (LTXT41N702, etc.) and the **404 error** mentioned.  \n  - Confirm if the Snow/Jamf integration is **correctly configured** for pre-stage enrollment.  \n\n- **Involve the CPE Team:**  \n  - Share this ticket with the **CPE team** (e.g., @Ashwin.Kumar) to ensure they\u2019re aware of the notification routing change.  \n  - Ask them to **validate** the new alert system (email or ticketing) and provide feedback.  \n\n---\n\n### **4. Document and Track**\n- **Update the Jira Ticket (CPE-3117):**  \n  - Add **comments** with your findings (e.g., \"Checked logs for 4W9JVTQX9: 404 error observed. Snow team to provide more details\").  \n  - Assign the ticket to the **Snow team** for immediate action on the API logs and integration.  \n  - Set a **deadline** to resolve the notification routing (e.g., \"Fix notification routing by EOD Friday\").  \n\n- **Create a Follow-Up Ticket (if needed):**  \n  If the Snow team can\u2019t resolve the 404 error quickly, create a **new ticket** in your team\u2019s system to track the issue and assign it to the integration team.  \n\n---\n\n### **Key People to Involve:**\n- **Snow Team** (for logs, configuration, error details).  \n- **CPE Team** (Ashwin.Kumar, for notification routing and validation).  \n- **Jamf Admin** (to confirm enrollment status and policies).  \n\n---\n\nLet me know if you need help drafting the email to the Snow team or setting up the notification rules in ServiceNow. We can execute this step-by-step!"}, "9aad8de12e92d1ac6fce43cab2dfbae3c7115134d599e3a709ddf432c6a08a11": {"summary": "<think>\nOkay, let me start by looking through the tickets provided. The user mentioned they work on Stories, Tasks, Epics, and Sub-tasks, so I need to consider all these categories.\n\nFirst, I'll check for any P1 or Critical tickets. The tickets listed are all P3, but maybe there's a mislabeling? Wait, no, the user said they're all P3. But the rules mention that P1/Critical tickets should take priority. Since there are none here, I need to focus on other factors.\n\nNext, looking at the status. Tickets that are \"In Progress\" need attention. Let's scan through. CPE-3008 is an Epic with a status of \"To Do\" but has a high age (273 days). However, the user's rule says \"In Progress\" tickets need attention. Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me check again. The only \"In Progress\" ticket is CPE-3008? No, looking back, the status column shows most are \"To Do,\" \"Backlog,\" \"In Progress\" for a few. Wait, CPE-3008 is \"To Do,\" but the status isn't In Progress. Let me check again. Wait, the user provided a list where most tickets are \"To Do,\" some \"In Progress,\" like CPE-3008? No, looking at the list again, the first ticket is CPE-3008 with status \"To Do,\" but maybe I missed others. Wait, no, the user's list shows:\n\nLooking at the tickets:\n\n- CPE-3008: Status \"To Do\"\n- CPE-3117: Status \"To Do\"\n- CPE-3118: Status \"To Do\"\n- CPE-3008: Epic, status To Do, age 273 days, has VOC_Feedback? No, the labels are only for CPE-3117 which has VOC_Feedback. \n\nWait, looking at the labels, CPE-3117 has \"VOC_Feedback\" which is a customer impact label. That's important. Also, the description mentions failure in auto-locking Macs via Snow integration. That's a security issue or a failure, which per rule 4 should be prioritized regardless of formal priority. \n\nAnother point: CPE-3117 is a Story with VOC_Feedback, which indicates customer impact. The problem is that devices failed to auto-lock, and they're not enrolled in Jamf but are in pre-stage enrollment. That's a critical issue because it's about device security and compliance. The user's rule 4 says to look for security issues, failures, or blocking problems regardless of formal priority. So even though it's P3, this is a security failure and should be top priority.\n\nThen, looking at other tickets with labels. CPE-2925 has a PRD label, but the description is about enhancing security and change management for Jamf. That's a security-related epic, but it's in To Do and hasn't been worked on yet. However, since CPE-3117 is a failure with immediate impact, that's more urgent.\n\nCPE-3117's next steps would be to investigate why devices are not being auto-locked, check the Snow integration logs, verify enrollment status, and ensure that devices in pre-stage enrollment are properly enrolled. The user might need to collaborate with the Snow team or check Jamf configurations.\n\nOther notable tickets: CPE-3008 (Uptime notifications) is an Epic with a long age (273 days), but it's about notifications, which might be important for observability but not as urgent as a security failure. CPE-2458 is an Epic with a very high age (579 days) but no immediate impact mentioned. CPE-3118 is about making LAPS passwords easier, which is a usability issue but not as critical.\n\nSo, the top priority is CPE-3117 due to the security failure and customer impact. The next steps would involve troubleshooting the auto-lock integration and ensuring proper enrollment. The user might need help with checking logs, verifying configurations, and coordinating with the Snow team.\n</think>\n\n**TOP PRIORITY TICKET: CPE-3117**  \n**Why?** This is a **security failure** with **customer impact** (VOC_Feedback label) and **directly blocks device compliance**. If devices can\u2019t auto-lock, it\u2019s a risk for data breaches, especially with unenrolled devices in pre-stage enrollment. This is a **blocking problem** that needs immediate resolution to ensure devices are secured and aligned with compliance standards.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps for CPE-3117:**  \n1. **Investigate why devices in pre-stage enrollment aren\u2019t being auto-locked** \u2013 Check Snow integration logs and confirm if enrollment scripts are failing.  \n2. **Validate Jamf enrollment status** \u2013 Are devices being enrolled correctly? If not, fix the pre-stage enrollment configuration.  \n3. **Collaborate with Snow team** \u2013 They may need to adjust their integration logic to ensure devices are enrolled before applying lock policies.  \n\n**How I Can Help:**  \n- I can draft a **checklist for troubleshooting Snow + Jamf enrollment** (e.g., verify API keys, check for enrollment timeout errors).  \n- I can help **document the root cause** once identified, so this doesn\u2019t recur.  \n- If needed, I can **flag this as a high-priority security incident** internally to escalate resources.  \n\n---\n\n**Other Notable Tickets:**  \n1. **CPE-3008 (Uptime notifications)** \u2013 This is a **long-standing Epic** (273 days old) with **observability impact**. If users aren\u2019t alerted to system outages, it could affect productivity. But it\u2019s less urgent than a security failure.  \n2. **CPE-2925 (Enhancing Jamf security & change management)** \u2013 A **security Epic** with no immediate impact, but it\u2019s critical for long-term risk mitigation. Start scoping this once CPE-3117 is resolved.  \n\n---\n\n**Quick Take:** Fix CPE-3117 first to secure devices, then tackle CPE-3008 and CPE-2925.
