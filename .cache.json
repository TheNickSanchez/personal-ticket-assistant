The user has provided a list of tickets and wants help prioritizing their workload. First, I need to go through each ticket and apply the priority rules they mentioned.\n\nStarting with the priority rules: P1/Critical tickets are top priority, but all these are P3. Next, \"In Progress\" tickets need attention. Then, very old tickets over 300 days are less urgent unless high priority. Security issues, failures, or blocking problems are important regardless of priority. Also, business impact and VOC_Feedback labels matter.\n\nLooking through the tickets, the first one is CPE-3117 with the label VOC_Feedback. The status is \"To Do,\" but the description mentions failed auto lock on Macs via Snow integration. The user says devices aren't enrolled in Jamf but are in pre-stage enrollment. This seems like a failure that's affecting device management, which is critical for security. The VOC_Feedback label indicates customer impact, so this should be a top priority.\n\nNext, CPE-3118 is about making LAPS passwords easier for technicians. It's also a \"To Do\" with no labels, but the issue is about usability. Not as urgent as the previous one.\n\nCPE-3179 is a sub-task with no description. Not sure about its impact.\n\nLooking for other tickets, CPE-2458 is an epic that's been open for over 500 days. That's very old, but it's a security and architecture review. However, without a higher priority, maybe not urgent unless there's a security risk.\n\nCPE-2866 is about developing a policy on which computers should be locked. It's a \"To Do\" with no labels, so maybe lower priority.\n\nCPE-3117 seems the most urgent because of the VOC_Feedback and the failure in device management. The next step would be to investigate why the devices aren't enrolling, check the pre-stage enrollment settings, and ensure that the Snow integration is correctly configured. The user might need to work with the Snow team or check Jamf logs for errors. They might also need to create a KB article for troubleshooting enrollment failures, which is mentioned in CPE-3222.\n\nOther notable tickets: CPE-3118 (LAPS password issue) and CPE-2458 (security review). But the former is more about user experience, and the latter is a long-term project.\n\nSo, the top priority is CPE-3117 because of the customer impact and the failure in a critical process. The next steps are troubleshooting the enrollment issue and collaborating with relevant teams. The user might need help creating a KB article for future reference and ensuring that the Snow integration is properly set up.\n</think>\n\n**Top Priority Ticket: CPE-3117 - \"Failure - Auto lock macs via snow integration\"**  \n**Why?** This is a **critical failure in device management** with **VOC_Feedback** (customer impact). If devices aren\u2019t auto-locking, it creates a **security risk** (unsecured devices) and **impacts user experience** (users can\u2019t work securely). The ticket also mentions devices are in pre-stage enrollment but not enrolled in Jamf \u2014 this is a **blocker for automation** and could indicate a systemic issue in your enrollment process.  \n\n---\n\n### **Next Steps for CPE-3117**  \n1. **Troubleshoot the Snow integration**: Check if Snow is correctly configured to trigger auto-lock actions in Jamf. Are there logs in Snow/Jamf showing why devices aren\u2019t being enrolled?  \n2. **Validate pre-stage enrollment**: Why are devices in pre-stage but not enrolled? Is there a missing step (e.g., user interaction, missing payloads)?  \n3. **Create a KB article** (see CPE-3222): Document how to collect logs for failed enrollment to prevent this in the future.  \n\n---\n\n### **How I Can Help**  \n- **Dig into logs**: I can help draft a script or guide to pull logs from Snow/Jamf to identify why enrollment is failing.  \n- **Collaborate with Snow team**: If you need help coordinating with Snow or Jamf support, I can help draft a request.  \n- **Design a KB article**: I\u2019ll help structure the steps to troubleshoot enrollment failures.  \n\n---\n\n### **Other Notable Tickets**  \n1. **CPE-3118 - \"Make LAPS Passwords for GCS Admin Easier\"**: Technicians are struggling with 29-character passwords. This is a **user experience/blocker** for support teams. Fixing this would save time and reduce errors.  \n2. **CPE-2458 - \"Complete Jamf security & architecture review\"**: This is **578 days old** and labeled as a security review. While not urgent, if there\u2019s a known security gap (e.g., unpatched configs), this should be elevated.  \n\n---\n\n**Quick Summary**: Focus on **CPE-3117** first \u2014 it\u2019s a **security-critical failure** with customer impact. Then, address **CPE-3118** to improve technician workflows. Keep an eye on **CPE-2458** if security audits are pending. Let me know if you need help drafting logs or KB articles!"}}
