This ticket has been open for 209 days, which is a relatively long time. What's more concerning is that it's marked as \"To Do,\" indicating that someone hasn't had a chance to work on it yet.\n\nThe issue here is a security vulnerability that could allow unauthorized access to devices in your environment. The VOC_Feedback label indicates that this is a customer-impacting problem, and I strongly advise we address it ASAP.\n\n**Next Concrete Steps:**\nTo tackle this ticket, I recommend the following next steps:\n\n1. Review the current implementation of Snow integration with Jamf to understand where the issue lies.\n2. Reach out to your Snow admin team to gather more information about the failure and identify potential root causes.\n3. Collaborate with the IT team to develop a plan to fix the issue, which might involve updating Snow or Jamf configurations.\n\n**Specific Ways I Can Help:**\nI can help you by:\n\n1. Reviewing the current Snow-Jamf integration setup to ensure we have all the necessary documentation and information.\n2. Helping you craft an email to the Snow admin team to get more information about the failure.\n3. Assisting with testing and validation of the proposed fix to ensure it resolves the issue.\n\n**Notable Tickets:**\nTwo other tickets that caught my attention are:\n\n1. **CPE-2925 [PRD] Enhancing Security and Change Management for Jamf**: This epic has been open for a while (320 days) and seems to be related to security and change management. While it's not as pressing as CPE-3117, I think we should keep an eye on this one since it involves critical aspects of our Jamf implementation.\n2. **EUSOPS-180 Review Enrolled Vendors to ABM**: This ticket has been open for 595 days, which is quite old. Given the VOC_Feedback label, I assume there's a business impact associated with this issue. Let's prioritize reviewing these vendors and validating their access to our Teneat.\n\nHow do you feel about tackling CPE-3117 first?

Given that it's a high-priority story (P3) and has been stagnant for 153 days, we need to get moving quickly to avoid it becoming stale forever.\n\nHere's my suggestion for the next logical step:\n\n**Next Step: Gather Requirements and Stakeholder Input**\n\nTo create a comprehensive knowledge base (KB) on collecting logs from local endpoints if they fail to enroll, we need to understand the user's requirements and any specific pain points they're facing. Let's reach out to the user who initially created this ticket and gather more information about their needs.\n\n**Action Items:**\n\n1. Send an email to the user with a brief summary of the current status of the ticket and ask them to provide more details on what kind of analysis and next steps they need.\n2. Schedule a call or meeting with the user to discuss their requirements and get feedback on any existing documents, guides, or resources that might be useful for the KB.\n3. Ask the user to share any existing logs, error messages, or configuration files that could help inform the content of the KB.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n* A summary document outlining the user's requirements and pain points\n* Any relevant logs, error messages, or configuration files shared by the user\n\nBy gathering more information from the user, we can create a more effective and targeted knowledge base that meets their needs.

This will help us avoid duplicating efforts and ensure we're building on top of existing knowledge.\n2. **Consult with Jamf support team**: Reach out to the Jamf support team to see if they have any recommendations or best practices for collecting logs in this scenario. Their expertise can be invaluable in providing technical insights.\n3. **Gather information from similar environments**: Research other environments (e.g., schools, businesses) that have implemented log collection for failed enrolment with Jamf. This will help us understand common challenges and solutions.\n4. **Define the scope and requirements of the KB article**: Determine what specific topics should be covered in the KB article, such as:\n\t* Log collection methods\n\t* Data retention policies\n\t* Log analysis tools\n\t* Common errors or issues\n\nOnce we have a good understanding of these factors, I can help you draft the KB article and ensure it's comprehensive and accurate.\n\nHow does this sound?

Here's a suggested next step:\n\n**Next Action:** Research existing Jamf documentation and logs collection resources.\n\n**Why:**\n\n1. We need to understand what's already available in terms of log collection instructions for failed enrollments.\n2. This will help us determine if there are any existing KBs or guides that we can leverage or build upon.\n3. By researching existing resources, we'll also identify potential pitfalls and areas where our KB can provide more value.\n\n**Specific Tasks:**\n\n1. Search for Jamf documentation on log collection and failed enrollments.\n2. Check the Jamf Support website, forums, and knowledge base to see if there are any relevant guides or articles.\n3. Review existing KBs related to log collection in Jamf Pro (if applicable).\n4. Take note of any specific configurations, settings, or troubleshooting steps that might be mentioned.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n* A list of existing resources found during the research phase\n* Any relevant screenshots or excerpts from documentation\n* A brief summary of what we can learn from these resources\n\nBy completing this task, we'll set ourselves up for success and ensure our KB provides the most comprehensive instructions possible.
