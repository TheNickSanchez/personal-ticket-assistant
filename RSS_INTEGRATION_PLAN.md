# Invisible RSS Intelligence Integration - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This feature will enhance the AI analysis by parsing Jira RSS activity feeds to provide more context-aware ticket prioritization without adding UI complexity. The system will automatically fetch and process RSS data to improve the reasoning behind ticket prioritization.

## Architecture Components

### 1. RSS Feed Processing Service
- Background service that runs on a configurable interval (default: 30 minutes)
- Fetches and parses Jira RSS activity feeds
- Extracts ticket IDs, activity types, timestamps, and authors
- Stores processed data in a database

### 2. Activity Metrics Storage
- New database table to store activity metrics
- Includes fields for ticket ID, last activity date, comment counts, and user activity
- Provides fast access to activity data for AI analysis

### 3. Enhanced AI Analysis Logic
- Integrates activity data with existing ticket information
- Generates more contextual reasoning based on recent activity patterns
- Improves priority score calculation based on activity patterns

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core RSS Processing (Week 1)
- [x] Create JiraRSSProcessor class
- [ ] Implement RSS feed fetching with authentication
- [ ] Develop XML parsing for activity extraction
- [ ] Set up activity_metrics database table
- [ ] Create scheduled background job for regular updates

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Week 2)
- [ ] Enhance WorkAssistant class to include activity data
- [ ] Update priority scoring algorithm with activity metrics
- [ ] Improve contextual reasoning generator
- [ ] Add activity-based metadata to ticket objects

### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment (Week 3)
- [ ] Create comprehensive tests for RSS processing
- [ ] Test integration with existing AI analysis
- [ ] Validate improved reasoning quality
- [ ] Deploy to development environment

### Phase 4: Refinement (Week 4)
- [ ] Monitor system performance and RSS processing
- [ ] Refine logic based on accuracy of recommendations
- [ ] Optimize database queries and caching
- [ ] Document the feature and its implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE activity_metrics (
    ticket_id VARCHAR(20),
    last_activity_date TIMESTAMP,
    recent_comment_count INTEGER,
    days_since_activity INTEGER,
    user_recently_active BOOLEAN,
    PRIMARY KEY(ticket_id)
);
```

### Key Files to Create/Modify
- `core/rss_processor.py` (new file)
- `core/work_assistant.py` (modify)
