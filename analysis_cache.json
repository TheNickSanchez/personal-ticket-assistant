The user mentioned they work on Stories, Tasks, Epics, and Sub-tasks, so I need to consider all these categories.\n\nFirst, I'll check for any P1 or Critical tickets. The tickets listed are all P3, but maybe there's a mislabeling? Wait, no, the user said they're all P3. But the rules mention that P1/Critical tickets should take priority. Since there are none here, I need to focus on other factors.\n\nNext, looking at the status. Tickets that are \"In Progress\" need attention. Let's scan through. CPE-3008 is an Epic with a status of \"To Do\" but has a high age (273 days). However, the user's rule says \"In Progress\" tickets need attention. Wait, maybe I missed some. Let me check again. The only \"In Progress\" ticket is CPE-3008? No, looking back, the status column shows most are \"To Do,\" \"Backlog,\" \"In Progress\" for a few. Wait, CPE-3008 is \"To Do,\" but the status isn't In Progress. Let me check again. Wait, the user provided a list where most tickets are \"To Do,\" some \"In Progress,\" like CPE-3008? No, looking at the list again, the first ticket is CPE-3008 with status \"To Do,\" but maybe I missed others. Wait, no, the user's list shows:\n\nLooking at the tickets:\n\n- CPE-3008: Status \"To Do\"\n- CPE-3117: Status \"To Do\"\n- CPE-3118: Status \"To Do\"\n- CPE-3008: Epic, status To Do, age 273 days, has VOC_Feedback? No, the labels are only for CPE-3117 which has VOC_Feedback. \n\nWait, looking at the labels, CPE-3117 has \"VOC_Feedback\" which is a customer impact label. That's important. Also, the description mentions failure in auto-locking Macs via Snow integration. That's a security issue or a failure, which per rule 4 should be prioritized regardless of formal priority. \n\nAnother point: CPE-3117 is a Story with VOC_Feedback, which indicates customer impact. The problem is that devices failed to auto-lock, and they're not enrolled in Jamf but are in pre-stage enrollment. That's a critical issue because it's about device security and compliance. The user's rule 4 says to look for security issues, failures, or blocking problems regardless of formal priority. So even though it's P3, this is a security failure and should be top priority.\n\nThen, looking at other tickets with labels. CPE-2925 has a PRD label, but the description is about enhancing security and change management for Jamf. That's a security-related epic, but it's in To Do and hasn't been worked on yet. However, since CPE-3117 is a failure with immediate impact, that's more urgent.\n\nCPE-3117's next steps would be to investigate why devices are not being auto-locked, check the Snow integration logs, verify enrollment status, and ensure that devices in pre-stage enrollment are properly enrolled. The user might need to collaborate with the Snow team or check Jamf configurations.\n\nOther notable tickets: CPE-3008 (Uptime notifications) is an Epic with a long age (273 days), but it's about notifications, which might be important for observability but not as urgent as a security failure. CPE-2458 is an Epic with a very high age (579 days) but no immediate impact mentioned. CPE-3118 is about making LAPS passwords easier, which is a usability issue but not as critical.\n\nSo, the top priority is CPE-3117 due to the security failure and customer impact. The next steps would involve troubleshooting the auto-lock integration and ensuring proper enrollment. The user might need help with checking logs, verifying configurations, and coordinating with the Snow team.\n</think>\n\n**TOP PRIORITY TICKET: CPE-3117**  \n**Why?** This is a **security failure** with **customer impact** (VOC_Feedback label) and **directly blocks device compliance**. If devices can\u2019t auto-lock, it\u2019s a risk for data breaches, especially with unenrolled devices in pre-stage enrollment. This is a **blocking problem** that needs immediate resolution to ensure devices are secured and aligned with compliance standards.\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps for CPE-3117:**  \n1. **Investigate why devices in pre-stage enrollment aren\u2019t being auto-locked** \u2013 Check Snow integration logs and confirm if enrollment scripts are failing.  \n2. **Validate Jamf enrollment status** \u2013 Are devices being enrolled correctly? If not, fix the pre-stage enrollment configuration.  \n3. **Collaborate with Snow team** \u2013 They may need to adjust their integration logic to ensure devices are enrolled before applying lock policies.  \n\n**How I Can Help:**  \n- I can draft a **checklist for troubleshooting Snow + Jamf enrollment** (e.g., verify API keys, check for enrollment timeout errors).  \n- I can help **document the root cause** once identified, so this doesn\u2019t recur.  \n- If needed, I can **flag this as a high-priority security incident** internally to escalate resources.  \n\n---\n\n**Other Notable Tickets:**  \n1. **CPE-3008 (Uptime notifications)** \u2013 This is a **long-standing Epic** (273 days old) with **observability impact**. If users aren\u2019t alerted to system outages, it could affect productivity. But it\u2019s less urgent than a security failure.  \n2. **CPE-2925 (Enhancing Jamf security & change management)** \u2013 A **security Epic** with no immediate impact, but it\u2019s critical for long-term risk mitigation. Start scoping this once CPE-3117 is resolved.  \n\n---\n\n**Quick Take:** Fix CPE-3117 first to secure devices, then tackle CPE-3008 and CPE-2925. Let me know if you need help drafting logs or coordinating with teams!", "top_key": "CPE-3117", "timestamp": "2025-09-03T13:37:32.374126"}}
